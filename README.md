Python Functions Programs
This repository contains various Python programs that demonstrate the use of functions. These programs cover basic to intermediate concepts, helping users understand how to define and use functions effectively in Python.

Overview
Functions are reusable blocks of code designed to perform a specific task. They help organize code, improve readability, and enable code reuse. This collection includes programs illustrating:

Defining functions

Function arguments and parameters

Return statements

Recursion

Lambda functions

Higher-order functions

Built-in functions usage

Contents
basic_functions.py — Examples of defining and calling simple functions

function_arguments.py — Demonstrates positional, keyword, default, and variable-length arguments

return_values.py — Functions with return statements

recursion_examples.py — Recursive functions like factorial and Fibonacci

lambda_functions.py — Usage of anonymous functions with lambda

higher_order_functions.py — Functions that take other functions as arguments (map, filter, reduce)

built_in_functions.py — Examples using Python’s built-in functions related to functions

How to Use
Clone or download the repository.

Run any Python file using a Python interpreter. For example:

text
python basic_functions.py
Explore the code and modify the functions to understand their behavior.

Requirements
Python 3.x
